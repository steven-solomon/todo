Another day working on this =). First off renamed items to tasks, makes more sense. I also encountered a little bit of trouble with the way I was using functions in the present task use-case. An inline function like

class Foo
  bar = ->
    do wibble ...

results in a static function across all instances of the class. We don't want that for any of our use cases so I went to instance methods. This is one of the fuzzy areas with JS as there aren't private methods. (leave that to Douglas Crockford to discuss).

It became evident that sorting shouldn't be a responsibility of the present use-case so it has been removed. I plan to leave that up to the query implementation in tasksGateway.

Implemented the listener pattern in the gateway first. I feel as though providing notifications and persistence will be separated. Probably will diagram that out tomorrow.
