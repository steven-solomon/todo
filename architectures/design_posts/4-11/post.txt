I discovered today that the App tests were misnamed. The App was actually the PresentItemsUseCase. I corrected this and remove the duplication that was beginning to build up. I noticed this when I felt like I was writing the same tests again at a different level of abstraction. I also introduced a domain object for a Task.

Spent some time thinking about the next step today, which is to add an item. This is a very interesting situation because now we have two use-cases. There is one to present the current items and one to add them (Single Responsibility Principal at work). However the presentation use-case cares about changes to the items. So we will need to introduce a callback here so that any updates to the state of the tasks will automatically notify the presentation that there is something new to be displayed.
I will most likely use the listener pattern here and the use-case will listen for updates on the gateway.

The diagrams have been updated to show the next goals.
